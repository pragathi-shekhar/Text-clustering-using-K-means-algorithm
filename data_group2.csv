6,"FED ' S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking , insurance , real estate and securities . In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts ' Association , Heller said , "" I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system ."" He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank , thrift , insurance , investment , securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines . "" Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions , and all transactions would have to be on an arms - length basis ,"" Heller said . Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks ' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries . Heller said he "" would require the holding company to serve as a ' source of strength ' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank ' s capital . "" In other words , the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth ."" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company , again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary . Heller said the effects of these actions "" would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them "" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to "" loot the bank "" was removed . Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States . Heller said that would mean "" the steady decline of America ' s banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested "" by permitting them to become more competitive ."

13,"BP & lt ; BP > DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD & lt ; SRD > BID British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co , BP Managing Director David Simon said . "" We don ' t seen this as any progressive bidding game ,"" he told reporters at a news conference . BP now owns 55 pct of Standard ' s stock . Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst , whom he would not identify , as saying BP ' s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer . "" I think that ( an increase ) would be totally wrong . I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation ,"" he said . "" Let ' s wait and see how the offer runs ."" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid . The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7 . 2 times Standard ' s 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company ' s assets , including the value of its oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves . He said the price Royal Dutch / Shell Group & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5 . 1 times cash flow . The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard ' s stock price over the past year . BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two - third ' s of the 7 . 4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources . The rest will be financed by new debt . BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit , he explained . The company ' s debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed , Chase said . But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months , he added . Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil ' s publicly held shares are held by financial institutions . Simon said Standard ' s board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time . He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition . "" We have informed Washington of our intentions and we ' ve already been an integral part of ownership of U . S . oil reserves ,"" he pointed out . Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained , and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production . "" We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime ,"" Simon said . "" We have hopes for greater stability , but we do not see prices going much higher ,"" he added ."

"" There ' s a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid ,"" said Rosario Ilaqua of L . F . Rothschild . And despite BP managing director David Simon ' s denial today that BP would raise the offer , the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility . Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch / Shell Group ' s & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985 . Royal Dutch / Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share , after lawsuits by minority shareholders . "" I think they ' re going to have to go a little higher eventually , just as Royal Dutch / Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares ,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said . He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share . Royal Dutch / Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30 . 5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984 . After objections from minority shareholders about the price , Royal Dutch / Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984 . But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer . After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil , Royal Dutch / Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase . It ended up paying 5 . 67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake , a significant premium to its original bid of about 5 . 2 billion dlrs . The analysts made their comments before Simon ' s remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon . Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible . The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share . Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch / Shell group precedent . But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason , they said .

Last year , the report noted , the cash flow from operations dropped to 1 . 8 billion dlrs from 3 . 5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3 . 2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices . The report , prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP > disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard ' s stock , put 1987 capital spending at 1 . 6 billion dlrs , down from the 1 . 7 billion dlrs projected in January .

The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2 . 41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2 . 65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11 . 4 mln barrels last year from 23 . 2 mln in 1985 .

It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct , a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said . In a letter sent yesterday , Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U . S . Firms that have expressed interest . But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role , he said . The move appears to be an effort to dampen U . S .

K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L >, industry analysts and diplomats said . One of the rival firms , & lt ; International Telecom Japan Inc > ( ITJ ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U . S .

Merrill Lynch and Co Inc & lt ; MER > and Pacific Telesis International Inc & lt ; PAC >, both of the U . S ., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively . The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor . It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier , such as Cable and Wireless , arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists . Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy , Jonathan Solomon , yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless ' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct , the ministry official said . Channeling the U . S . Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless ' share , industry analysts said . "" Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor ,"" Bache Securities ( Japan ) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said . "" Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount , but you won ' t find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding ,"" Whitten said . Western diplomatic sources were more blunt .

123,"AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc , but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock . American Express stock got a lift from the rumor , as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value , thereby boosting the total value of American Express . The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend . American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72 - 5 / 8 , up 4 - 1 / 8 on heavy volume . American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity . Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts ' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes . At the meeting , company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson , according to analysts . Yesterday , Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer , Jeffery Lane , to the added position of president , which had been vacant . It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions . Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense , contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff . Some analysts , however , disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express , contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year . "" I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson ,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical . He questioned what would be a better investment than "" a very profitable securities firm ."" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash , which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset . But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson , and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market . Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential - Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past . "" Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place . Shearson ' s book value is in the 1 . 4 mln dlr range . Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3 . 5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization ,"" said Eckenfelder . Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally . "" They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital . You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road ,"" said E . F . Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis . "" They ' ve outlined the fact that they ' re investing heavily in the future , which goes heavily into the international arena ,"" said Lewis . ""... That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way ,"" he said . Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson , its stock might better reflect other assets , such as the travel related services business . "" It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage . The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company ,"" he said . Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after - tax operating earnings , up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985 ."

Department of Transportation ( DOT ) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc . "" The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest ,"" the DOT said in a statement . AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp . The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb . 20 . American is the third largest U . S . airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal -- a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities -- is the nation ' s 17th largest passenger carrier . Their merger would not alter American ' s third - place ranking , according to data compiled by Aviation Daily , a leading industry trade magazine . The combination would incrase American ' s share of the U . S . market to 15 . 4 pct from its current 14 . 7 pct , the DOT said . The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single - plane service . At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers , the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American - AirCal . Concerning the 14th , "" While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future , DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area , especially at the Los Angeles International Airport , will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long - haul markets ,"" the DOT said . The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal , where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion . The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but "" raised no new facts or arguments .""

Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the full value of the company . In a letter to shareholders , Chairman A . William Reynolds said the offer is a "" highly conditional , contingently financed bust - up offer "" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value of their investment in Gencorp . Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers . He said the board has authorized management to explore alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a "" financially superior "" alternative to the general acquisition offer . A Gencorp spokesman , in response to questions , would not comment on market speculation that the company ' s management may develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own . He would also not comment on when a better alternative might be developed . Gencorp ' s stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer price since the tender was made . Today , Gencorp closed at 114 - 1 / 4 , up 1 - 5 / 8 . Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years , Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder value , and the stock price and earnings have improved since he joined the company . Gencorp said the partnership ' s offer is a "" bargain price "" acquisition that was "" using financing from a syndicate of banks that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide ."" Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical alteration and selloff of Gencorp ' s assets , including Aerojet General to refinance General Acquisition ' s borrowings with the profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of shareholders . The letter also said the General Acquisition offer "" jeopardizes the security and interests "" of its shareholders , employees , customers , suppliers and the communities throughout the country where the company ' s facilities are located ."

The company said it was studying financially superior alternatives . The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive , particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp . The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "" superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill ."" Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive .

"" The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float ,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement . Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership . With the sale , CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier , he said . As reported separately , soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68 . 26 pct of & lt ; Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd > that it does not already hold , valuing its entire issued capital at 219 . 6 mln dlrs .

Kelman said a revaluation of CSR ' s investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today , CSR ' s annual balance - date , will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs . However , revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss , he said .

S > has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . "" It sounds like a good deal ,"" Stuart McKibbin of & lt ; A . C . Goode and Co > told Reuters . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the & lt ; Delhi Australia Fund > and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > unit & lt ; Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc > for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia ' s largest sugar refiner , made a 2 . 20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in & lt ; Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd >. "" This will be a big shock to the market , which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi ,"" McKibbin said . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright , CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best - performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U . S . Dlrs a barrel in the next two years . Delhi is one of Australia ' s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin . Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs . Neale Goldston - Morris of Sydney broker & lt ; Bain and Co Ltd > said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian - owned assets to a foreign company . "" The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans ,"" Goldston - Morris said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia ' s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , analysts said . They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year , they said . Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment , made in 1981 , which has dragged down the company ' s overall performance , analysts said . CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U . S . Dlr investment financed entirely from U . S . Dollar debt , they said . "" It was a bad investment for them . They financed it entirely with debt , the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them ,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker & lt ; Meares and Philips Ltd > said . Esso not only picked up Delhi ' s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions . Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50 / 50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S >.

Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from General Acquisition , an affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc , and said it was studying financially superior alternatives . The General Acquisition partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive , particularly since it had tried to discuss the offer with Gencorp . The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "" superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill ."" Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make takeovers more expensive . Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to put off the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock to April 6 from April 3 . It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp before April 6 . General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements .

199,"TALKING POINT / BORG - WARNER CORP & lt ; BOR > Borg - Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp ' s 46 - dlr - per - share takeover offer , but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer , either from GAF or its own management , analysts believe . Analysts also said Borg - Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring . The speculation pushed Borg - Warner ' s stock up 1 - 3 / 8 to 48 - 1 / 2 in heavy trading . Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg - Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF . "" It seems from at least their dealing with ( raider Irwin ) Jacobs that they don ' t want to be taken over . The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF . I think instinctively , they want to remain independent ,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps . Borg - Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year . Last week , Jacobs ' investment vehicle , Minstar Inc , and an investor group sold its 10 . 1 mln Borg - Warner shares . The same day , GAF Corp raised its stake by 9 . 1 mln shares to 19 . 9 pct of the outstanding . Jacobs was interested in buying the company , but took no steps toward a transaction . "" Their ( Borg - Warner ) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months . It ' s been one of the dullest corporate battles I ' ve seen ,"" said one analyst . The battle , however , has heated up , and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share . Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate . Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3 . 16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg - Warner . Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg - Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way . Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp , but GAF benefited from that company ' s restructuring . "" Borg Warner can ' t quibble that it ' s not a legitimate offer . It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place . They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it ' s sweetened . I personally think the company is ( worth ) around 55 dlrs per share ,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson . Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith . The company bought back the financier ' s stock and carried out a wider share repurchase . Arbitragers , however , said they do not believe Heyman is seeking "" greenmail ,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium . Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction . Previously associated with "" junk bond "" experts , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , GAf said it would finance its Borg - Warner takeover with bank financing . GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg - WArner board and conditioned on the board ' s recommendation of the tender offer and merger . Heyman said in a letter to Borg - Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg - Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap . Analysts , however , believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction . GAF ' s stock rose 1 - 5 / 8 today , to 48 - 5 / 8 . "" I believe , obviously , if GAF takes over Borg - Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially ,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose . He said at 46 dlrs per share , Heyman ' s average cost for the company ' s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF ' s current holdings . Rose said the Borg - Warner plastics and chemical business , which makes thermo - plastics is the asset attracting Heyman . Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg ' s earnings . The plastics are used in telephone equipment , office equipment and appliances . "" Borg has half the market in the U . S . and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator ,"" Rose said . Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co & lt ; DOW > and Monsanto Corp & lt ; MTC >, he said . Borg - Warner also has an automotive parts business , and a protective systems business , which includes Wells Fargo security guards . It also has an information services business , and is trying to sell its financial services business . Borg - Warner earned 206 . 1 mln dlrs or 2 . 35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3 . 62 billion dlrs in 1986 . Smaller GAF , in 1986 , earned on an operating basis 80 . 7 mln dlrs or 2 . 22 dlrs per share on sales of 753 . 8 mln dlrs . GAF ' s net earnings included an after tax gain of 201 . 4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer , a special union carbide dividend , and the sale of its Union Carbide shares ."

252,"U . S . SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA - WESTERN MERGER U . S . Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta & lt ; DAL > Airlines Inc and Western Airlines & lt ; WAL >, the Court said . O ' Connor ' s action came hours after a three - judge panel of the 9th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration . A Supreme Court spokesman said O ' Connor granted a stay of the injuction , allowing the merger , worth nearly 860 mln dlrs , to go through as planned later today . The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details . Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment . The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta - based Delta , which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western , which has headquartera in Los Angeles . "" Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight ,"" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night . "" There was really very little that remained to be done ."" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western ' s management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place . The airlines argued that Western ' s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company . After learning of the appeals court ruling , Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms , not in new Delta outfits . Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western . The merger took place in December , and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then . The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night . At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines . While all but eight pct of Western ' s 11 , 000 employees are unionized , only Delta ' s pilots are union members . Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters , as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be "" extinguished "" after today ."

300,"CONRAC & lt ; CAX > EXPLORING RESTRUCTURING , BUYOUT Conrac Corp , whose board has rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries Inc & lt ; IV >, said it is exploring alternatives such as a restructuring , leveraged buyout or takeover of the company . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV offer , which it said it considers inadequate . The alternatives being explored include a restructuring , leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another company , Conrac said . Conrac , which said its board discussed the alternatives at special meetings on March 26 and 30 , said that its decision on whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "" the future actions of Mark IV "" and its unsolicitied tender offer . Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer , it said . Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it becomes final , the company said . The board also took other defensive steps , including granting severance agreements to some officers , it said . At a board meeting yesterday , Concac ' s directors deleted a provision allowing the holder of at least one - third of of all classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to remove directors without cause , the company said . The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority of the company ' s common stock in the offer , Conrac said . Conrac ' s president , vice president and treasurer were given severance agreements , or "" golden parachutes ,"" it said .

Smorada ' s salary was not listed in the SEC filing . The executives would also get cash settlements of options plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits ."

309,"TALKING POINT / PUROLATOR COURIER & lt ; PCC > Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs , but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface . Purolator ' s stock climbed 5 - 3 / 8 today , to 40 - 1 / 8 , 1 / 4 over Emery ' s 40 dlr per share offer . Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E . F . Hutton LBO Inc . Some analysts said the latest , 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations . Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range . At least one , however , estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share . Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made , but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher . "" They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer . Emery has shown the courage to go forth ,"" said one arbitrager , who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders . "" It makes sense ,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey . But "" It won ' t make out as well as they think . They won ' t get a 100 pct of the synergies ."" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term , but long term , after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets , it should boost Emery ' s profitability . Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U . S . package delivery company after Federal Express Corp & lt ; FDX >, which has 47 pct of the market . Parker speculated that the combined Emery - Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business . "" This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight ( delivery ) business , but it will not make them a power house ,"" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder , Peabody and Co . Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer , and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call . E . F . Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer , but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST . One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer . However , he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company . Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E . F . Hutton Group & lt ; EFH > subsidiary , speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come . The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member , Doresy Gardner resigned in March . Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity . A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery , nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator . Purolator ' s deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week , which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth . Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday . Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator . Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr "" bridge "" loan that would later be replaced with other debt . Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator . Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan . Emery last year lost 5 . 4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887 . 5 mln dlrs . Purolator lost 57 . 6 mln dlrs on 841 . 4 mln dlrs in revenues ."

He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank , thrift , insurance , investment , securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines . "" Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions , and all transactions would have to be on an arms - length basis ,"" Heller said . Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks ' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries .

"" In other words , the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth ."" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company , again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary . Heller said the effects of these actions "" would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them "" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to "" loot the bank "" was removed . Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States .

13,"BP & lt ; BP > DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD & lt ; SRD > BID British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co , BP Managing Director David Simon said . "" We don ' t seen this as any progressive bidding game ,"" he told reporters at a news conference . BP now owns 55 pct of Standard ' s stock . Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst , whom he would not identify , as saying BP ' s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer . "" I think that ( an increase ) would be totally wrong . I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation ,"" he said . "" Let ' s wait and see how the offer runs ."" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid . The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7 . 2 times Standard ' s 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company ' s assets , including the value of its oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves . He said the price Royal Dutch / Shell Group & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5 . 1 times cash flow . The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard ' s stock price over the past year . BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two - third ' s of the 7 . 4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources . The rest will be financed by new debt . BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit , he explained . The company ' s debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed , Chase said . But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months , he added . Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil ' s publicly held shares are held by financial institutions . Simon said Standard ' s board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time . He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition . "" We have informed Washington of our intentions and we ' ve already been an integral part of ownership of U . S . oil reserves ,"" he pointed out . Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained , and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production . "" We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime ,"" Simon said . "" We have hopes for greater stability , but we do not see prices going much higher ,"" he added ."

Earlier today , BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co ' s & lt ; SRD > publicly held stock .

In his speech , Roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the U . S . to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986 . "" I expect by the early 1990s the U . S . will be running a net trade surplus ,"" Roderick said . "" I think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead ."" However , the USX chairman warned that European trading partners may resist the turn in the U . S . trade deficit .

24,"BP & lt ; BP > MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID - ANALYSTS British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co & lt ; SRD >, analysts said . "" There ' s a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid ,"" said Rosario Ilaqua of L . F . Rothschild . And despite BP managing director David Simon ' s denial today that BP would raise the offer , the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility . Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch / Shell Group ' s & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985 . Royal Dutch / Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share , after lawsuits by minority shareholders . "" I think they ' re going to have to go a little higher eventually , just as Royal Dutch / Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares ,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said . He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share . Royal Dutch / Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30 . 5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984 . After objections from minority shareholders about the price , Royal Dutch / Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984 . But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer . After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil , Royal Dutch / Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase . It ended up paying 5 . 67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake , a significant premium to its original bid of about 5 . 2 billion dlrs . The analysts made their comments before Simon ' s remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon . Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible . The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share . Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch / Shell group precedent . But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason , they said . Goldman Sachs and Co , BP ' s investment advisor , advised the Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985 ."

Last year , the report noted , the cash flow from operations dropped to 1 . 8 billion dlrs from 3 . 5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3 . 2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices . The report , prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP > disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard ' s stock , put 1987 capital spending at 1 . 6 billion dlrs , down from the 1 . 7 billion dlrs projected in January . Standard ' s capital spending totaled 1 . 77 billion dlrs in 1986 . The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2 . 41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2 . 65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11 . 4 mln barrels last year from 23 . 2 mln in 1985 .

It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct , a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said . In a letter sent yesterday , Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U . S . Firms that have expressed interest . But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role , he said . The move appears to be an effort to dampen U . S .

K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L >, industry analysts and diplomats said .

Merrill Lynch and Co Inc & lt ; MER > and Pacific Telesis International Inc & lt ; PAC >, both of the U . S ., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively . The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor . It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier , such as Cable and Wireless , arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists . Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy , Jonathan Solomon , yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless ' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct , the ministry official said .

123,"AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc , but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock . American Express stock got a lift from the rumor , as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value , thereby boosting the total value of American Express . The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend . American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72 - 5 / 8 , up 4 - 1 / 8 on heavy volume . American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity . Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts ' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes . At the meeting , company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson , according to analysts . Yesterday , Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer , Jeffery Lane , to the added position of president , which had been vacant . It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions . Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense , contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff . Some analysts , however , disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express , contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year . "" I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson ,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical . He questioned what would be a better investment than "" a very profitable securities firm ."" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash , which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset . But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson , and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market . Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential - Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past . "" Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place . Shearson ' s book value is in the 1 . 4 mln dlr range . Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3 . 5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization ,"" said Eckenfelder . Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally . "" They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital . You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road ,"" said E . F . Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis . "" They ' ve outlined the fact that they ' re investing heavily in the future , which goes heavily into the international arena ,"" said Lewis . ""... That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way ,"" he said . Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson , its stock might better reflect other assets , such as the travel related services business . "" It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage . The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company ,"" he said . Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after - tax operating earnings , up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985 ."

140,"U . S . DOT APPROVES AMERICAN & lt ; AMR >- ACI & lt ; ACF > PACT The U . S . Department of Transportation ( DOT ) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc . "" The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest ,"" the DOT said in a statement . AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp . The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb . 20 . American is the third largest U . S . airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal -- a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities -- is the nation ' s 17th largest passenger carrier . Their merger would not alter American ' s third - place ranking , according to data compiled by Aviation Daily , a leading industry trade magazine . The combination would incrase American ' s share of the U . S . market to 15 . 4 pct from its current 14 . 7 pct , the DOT said . The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single - plane service . At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers , the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American - AirCal . Concerning the 14th , "" While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future , DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area , especially at the Los Angeles International Airport , will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long - haul markets ,"" the DOT said . The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal , where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion . The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but "" raised no new facts or arguments ."" Under the merger terms , announced Nov . 17 , American will pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings ."

Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the full value of the company . In a letter to shareholders , Chairman A . William Reynolds said the offer is a "" highly conditional , contingently financed bust - up offer "" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value of their investment in Gencorp . Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers .

Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years , Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder value , and the stock price and earnings have improved since he joined the company . Gencorp said the partnership ' s offer is a "" bargain price "" acquisition that was "" using financing from a syndicate of banks that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide ."" Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical alteration and selloff of Gencorp ' s assets , including Aerojet General to refinance General Acquisition ' s borrowings with the profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of shareholders .

Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership . With the sale , CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier , he said .

Kelman said a revaluation of CSR ' s investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today , CSR ' s annual balance - date , will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs . However , revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss , he said .

156,"ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR ' S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI CSR Ltd & lt ; CSRA . S > has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . "" It sounds like a good deal ,"" Stuart McKibbin of & lt ; A . C . Goode and Co > told Reuters . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the & lt ; Delhi Australia Fund > and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > unit & lt ; Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc > for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia ' s largest sugar refiner , made a 2 . 20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in & lt ; Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd >. "" This will be a big shock to the market , which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi ,"" McKibbin said . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright , CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best - performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U . S . Dlrs a barrel in the next two years . Delhi is one of Australia ' s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin . Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs . Neale Goldston - Morris of Sydney broker & lt ; Bain and Co Ltd > said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian - owned assets to a foreign company . "" The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans ,"" Goldston - Morris said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia ' s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , analysts said . They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year , they said . Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment , made in 1981 , which has dragged down the company ' s overall performance , analysts said . CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U . S . Dlr investment financed entirely from U . S . Dollar debt , they said . "" It was a bad investment for them . They financed it entirely with debt , the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them ,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker & lt ; Meares and Philips Ltd > said . Esso not only picked up Delhi ' s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions . Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50 / 50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S >.

The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business .

Gardini , commenting on Callebaut ' s remarks , said "" Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC ' s European business .""

199,"TALKING POINT / BORG - WARNER CORP & lt ; BOR > Borg - Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp ' s 46 - dlr - per - share takeover offer , but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer , either from GAF or its own management , analysts believe . Analysts also said Borg - Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring . The speculation pushed Borg - Warner ' s stock up 1 - 3 / 8 to 48 - 1 / 2 in heavy trading . Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg - Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF . "" It seems from at least their dealing with ( raider Irwin ) Jacobs that they don ' t want to be taken over . The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF . I think instinctively , they want to remain independent ,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps . Borg - Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year . Last week , Jacobs ' investment vehicle , Minstar Inc , and an investor group sold its 10 . 1 mln Borg - Warner shares . The same day , GAF Corp raised its stake by 9 . 1 mln shares to 19 . 9 pct of the outstanding . Jacobs was interested in buying the company , but took no steps toward a transaction . "" Their ( Borg - Warner ) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months . It ' s been one of the dullest corporate battles I ' ve seen ,"" said one analyst . The battle , however , has heated up , and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share . Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate . Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3 . 16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg - Warner . Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg - Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way . Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp , but GAF benefited from that company ' s restructuring . "" Borg Warner can ' t quibble that it ' s not a legitimate offer . It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place . They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it ' s sweetened . I personally think the company is ( worth ) around 55 dlrs per share ,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson . Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith . The company bought back the financier ' s stock and carried out a wider share repurchase . Arbitragers , however , said they do not believe Heyman is seeking "" greenmail ,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium . Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction . Previously associated with "" junk bond "" experts , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , GAf said it would finance its Borg - Warner takeover with bank financing . GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg - WArner board and conditioned on the board ' s recommendation of the tender offer and merger . Heyman said in a letter to Borg - Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg - Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap . Analysts , however , believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction . GAF ' s stock rose 1 - 5 / 8 today , to 48 - 5 / 8 . "" I believe , obviously , if GAF takes over Borg - Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially ,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose . He said at 46 dlrs per share , Heyman ' s average cost for the company ' s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF ' s current holdings . Rose said the Borg - Warner plastics and chemical business , which makes thermo - plastics is the asset attracting Heyman . Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg ' s earnings . The plastics are used in telephone equipment , office equipment and appliances . "" Borg has half the market in the U . S . and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator ,"" Rose said . Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co & lt ; DOW > and Monsanto Corp & lt ; MTC >, he said . Borg - Warner also has an automotive parts business , and a protective systems business , which includes Wells Fargo security guards . It also has an information services business , and is trying to sell its financial services business . Borg - Warner earned 206 . 1 mln dlrs or 2 . 35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3 . 62 billion dlrs in 1986 . Smaller GAF , in 1986 , earned on an operating basis 80 . 7 mln dlrs or 2 . 22 dlrs per share on sales of 753 . 8 mln dlrs .

On March one , Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc , a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc . Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management - led buyout offer . In a letter to Purolator ' s chairman , Nicholas F . Brady , Emery ' s chairman , John C . Emery , said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator . But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group ' s offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own . Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28 , unless extended . The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two - thirds of Purolator ' s shares outstanding , on a fully diluted basis , and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan . Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator ' s Canadian operations .

It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate , payable twice a year . For the first three years after the notes are issued , interest will be paid , at Emery ' s option , in cash or in additional notes , Emery said . It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued . Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger . It said it hoped Purolator ' s management would continue with the company . "" We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future ,"" Emery ' s chairman said in his letter .

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta & lt ; DAL > Airlines Inc and Western Airlines & lt ; WAL >, the Court said . O ' Connor ' s action came hours after a three - judge panel of the 9th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration . A Supreme Court spokesman said O ' Connor granted a stay of the injuction , allowing the merger , worth nearly 860 mln dlrs , to go through as planned later today . The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details . Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment . The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta - based Delta , which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western , which has headquartera in Los Angeles . "" Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight ,"" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night . "" There was really very little that remained to be done ."" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western ' s management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place . The airlines argued that Western ' s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company . After learning of the appeals court ruling , Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms , not in new Delta outfits . Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western . The merger took place in December , and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then . The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night . At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines . While all but eight pct of Western ' s 11 , 000 employees are unionized , only Delta ' s pilots are union members . Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters , as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be "" extinguished "" after today ."

309,"TALKING POINT / PUROLATOR COURIER & lt ; PCC > Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs , but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface . Purolator ' s stock climbed 5 - 3 / 8 today , to 40 - 1 / 8 , 1 / 4 over Emery ' s 40 dlr per share offer . Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E . F . Hutton LBO Inc . Some analysts said the latest , 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations . Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range . At least one , however , estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share . Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made , but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher . "" They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer . Emery has shown the courage to go forth ,"" said one arbitrager , who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders . "" It makes sense ,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey . But "" It won ' t make out as well as they think . They won ' t get a 100 pct of the synergies ."" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term , but long term , after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets , it should boost Emery ' s profitability . Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U . S . package delivery company after Federal Express Corp & lt ; FDX >, which has 47 pct of the market . Parker speculated that the combined Emery - Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business . "" This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight ( delivery ) business , but it will not make them a power house ,"" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder , Peabody and Co . Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer , and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call . E . F . Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer , but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST . One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer . However , he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company . Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E . F . Hutton Group & lt ; EFH > subsidiary , speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come . The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member , Doresy Gardner resigned in March . Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity . A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery , nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator . Purolator ' s deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week , which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth . Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday . Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator . Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr "" bridge "" loan that would later be replaced with other debt . Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator . Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan . Emery last year lost 5 . 4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887 . 5 mln dlrs . Purolator lost 57 . 6 mln dlrs on 841 . 4 mln dlrs in revenues ."

In October 1985 , the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent , the Polaroid spokesman said . Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow ' s hearing . Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on .

However , the plan , unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe , does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have . "" The share holdings of the core companies should be equal ,"" Watanabe said in a statement . "" The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies ."" He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm . "" The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself ,"" Watanabe said . Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups , one of which included C and W , seeking to compete against & lt ; Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd >, which now monopolizes Japan ' s overseas telephone business . The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe ' s efforts . A British source , who declined to be identified further , said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W & lt ; CAWL . L > and the other firms involved . C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm , compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed . C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge . The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion . "" It ' s probably a sensible approach on their part ,"" the British source told reuters . C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U . S . The proposed merger has sparked an international row , with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms . The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London . The U . S .

Under the Japanese law , total foreign participation would be limited to one - third .

344,"COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES & lt ; San Miguel Corp >, SMC , and & lt ; United Coconut Planters Bank >, UCPB , have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38 . 1 mln shares of SMC , the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said . Ramon Diaz , Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government ( PCGG ) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block , held in trust by the UCPB . "" It looks good ,"" Diaz said . But he added several issues , including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares , had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale . The PCGG ' s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC ' s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group . The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco , an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos . Cojuango , who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled , personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC . His holdings are also under sequestration . "" The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1 . 4 mln coconut farmers ,"" Diaz said . "" Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies ."" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC ' s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year . The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3 . 3 billion pesos . PCGG sources said SMC , the Philippines ' largest food and beverage manufacturer , has agreed to sell 14 mln "" B "" class shares from the 38 . 1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share . The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4 . 79 billion peso transaction , 1 . 6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment , the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC , 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB - controlled trading companies . The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares , which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year . A spokesman for SMC said the company ' s 15 - member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise . The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting , saying the dispute was under arbitration . President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three - man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue . The panel is due to submit its report by April 15 . Eduardo de Los Angeles , a government nominee in the SMC board , filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week , accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating "" fiduciary duty .""

369,"TALKING POINT / SANTA FE SOUTHERN & lt ; SFX > Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group & lt ; HENG >, which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate , analysts said . Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week , but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention . Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties , which hang in regulatory limbo . Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents , while its long - term debt to capital was just over 25 pct . "" This gives them plenty of borrowing power ,"" he said , which could be used against an unwanted suitor . Henley Group ' s Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies . He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs . Santa Fe officials don ' t appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover . "" I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern ,"" one Santa Fe executive said about Henley . "" I think it ' s wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe ,"" said Mark Hassenberg , who covers Henley for DLJ Securities . Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe ' s land assets are likely to be realized slowly . They add that Santa Fe ' s efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo , sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future . These realities , they said , support the Henley Group ' s statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment . The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads , the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co . The merger would create the nation ' s second - longest railroad . Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds . The company since has granted trackage - sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC ' s concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three - year - old struggle to merge the lines . "" My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings ,"" Fischer said . "" I believe they ' ve made an effort to satisfy the ICC ' s objections ,"" he said . "" But in doing so they haven ' t pleased everyone . Before they had Burlington Northern on their side , now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up ."" If the hearings are reopened , analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say , and up to another year for the ICC to decide . Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50 - mln - share stock buyback program begun in 1984 . It has bought back 33 . 7 mln shares as of February 1 , when it had 154 . 7 mln shares outstanding , a spokesman said . Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern , one of 3 . 4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1 . 7 mln shares in 1985 , one analyst said . James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit . Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern , he said one of Santa Fe ' s options , if threatened , could be to buy the Henley stake . "" It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low - risk , opportunistic investment ,"" Voytko said . "" People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share ,"" said DLJ Securities ' Hassenberg . "" But I ' m certain that in Dingman ' s mind , the company is worth more than that in breakup value ."""

405,"SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed . Specifically , the agency said those making tender offers for companies ' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid . Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions . As a result , a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached . In an interpretation of current rules , which officials said clarifies the SEC ' s present position , the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived , even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so . The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a "" material change "" of the tender offer under U . S . securities law , SEC officials said . The SEC has already said that other specific material changes , such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered , made during the course of a tender offer require a 10 - day extension of the offer . The length of the extension , which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer , was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived . SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case , but would generally be between five and 10 days . The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer , denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information . Officials declined to identify the two offers . "" If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer , it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination ,"" the SEC said . Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days ."

A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4 . 9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company . An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor . The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share , or for a total of 680 mln dlrs . A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available . Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership . Wayne Jones , vice president at Outboard for strategic planning , said management wants to stay independent . "" We are not trying to sell the company . We are proceeding with our strategic plans ,"" he said . That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December . Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs . An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "" decent "" price for outboard .

"" We ' ve had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems "" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview . Redstone also said "" Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals ."" Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan . But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom ' s independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National . National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters . It is dwarfed by Viacom .

526,"TWA & lt ; TWA > TANGLES PIEDMONT & lt ; PIE > SITUATION Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or , alternatively , to merge with Piedmont and USAir . Piedmont ' s board was meeting today , and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir . The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin . TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share . It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price . TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont , but it said it alternatively would discuss a three - way combination of the airlines . Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena . "" We ' re just wondering if he ' s not just trying to get TWA into play . There ' s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else ,"" said one arbitrager . "" We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon ."" Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir , but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals . They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements . "" They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance . I think it ' s a credible offer ,"" said Timothy Pettee , a Bear Stearns analyst . "" I think it ' s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals ,"" said Pettee . Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers . USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer . A spokesman for USAir declined comment , and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont . USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline ' s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock . USAir closed up 5 - 3 / 8 at 49 - 1 / 8 on volume of 1 . 9 mln shares . Piedmont , which slipped 1 / 2 to close at 69 - 5 / 8 , also remained silent on the TWA action . Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp . Norfolk Southern declined comment , but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont . Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont . Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target . "" Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers . I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive . One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines ,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming . "" I don ' t know whose going to buy them , but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package ,"" said Kim . But Icahn ' s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt , in part because of TWA ' s heavy debt load . Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer . The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements . Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp & lt ; X > and still retains 11 pct of that company ' s stock . Some Wall street sources said the financier ' s USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , because of Wall Street ' s insider trading scandal . Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns . "" It ' s littered with contingencies and it doesn ' t even have a financing arrangement ,"" said one executive at another major airline . But the executive conceded a merged TWA - USAir would be a strong contender with USAir ' s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA . USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA , which has a midwest presence in its St . Louis hub . Adding Piedmont , dominant in the southeast , to the mix would develop an even stronger force . The combined entity would also have TWA ' s pars reservation system . Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share ."

"" We ' re working very hard on this merger .""

The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree .

He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government ' s conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets .

583,"TALKING POINT / PIEDMONT & lt ; PIE > Carl Icahn ' s bold takeover bid for USAir Group & lt ; U > has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc , which was being courted by USAir . Yesterday , Icahn ' s Transworld Airlines Inc & lt ; TWA > made a 1 . 4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group . The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont , which was believed to be close to accepting the bid . Today , USAir rejected Icahn ' s 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last - minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont . Icahn was unavailable for comment . Piedmont fell one to 68 - 5 / 8 on volume of 963 , 000 . TWA was off 3 / 8 to 31 - 1 / 2 . USAir fell 1 - 3 / 8 to 47 - 3 / 4 as doubt spread it would be taken over . Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged . "" The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal ,"" speculated one arbitrager . Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir ' s bid will succeed . Piedmont ' s largest shareholder and other suitor , Norfolk Southern Corp & lt ; NSC > has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company . USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock , and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance . Some arbitragers , however , believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone . USAir , they said , is the least likely to be bought . Icahn , who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry , also offered USAir the alternative of a three - way airline combination , including TWA and Piedmont . But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn ' s offer , which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies . Still , he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA . "" You can ' t discount him ,"" said one arbitrager . Analysts , however , said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer . In making the offer for USAir , Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer . "" It ' s clear Icahn wants to sell and he ' s bluffing ,"" said one arbitrager . Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share . Some analysts believe Icahn ' s proposed three - way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles , but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately . "" TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work ,"" said one analyst . Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated . TWA has the best cost structure , since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions . In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA ' s wage scale in a merger , TWA would have to be the surviving entity , analysts said . Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA , they said . They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines ' costs when he merged it into TWA last year , and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work . However , other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company . They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir ' s airline is then merged into TWA ."

The proposed merger that would create a 1 . 2 billion dlr oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when Hughes management , balking at the terms of a government consent decree , offered a counter - proposal to Baker . Earlier today , Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker . Hughes chairman W . A .

592,"HUGHES & lt ; HT > CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about - face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp & lt ; BKO >, Wall Street analysts said . Last night , Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off . Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger . At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger . The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate . There was speculation today that Harold Simmons , the Dallas investor , might try to acquire Hughes , but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested . Simmons said he intends to file a 13 - D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company . He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes . One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg - Warner Corp & lt ; BOR >, which owns 18 . 5 pct of Hughes . Borg - Warner ex - chairman J . F . Bere , who serves on the Hughes board , is believed to favor the merger with Baker . Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger , and Baker ' s response that a merger is still possibile , analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going . "" I think the merger is not going through ,"" said Phil Pace , analyst at Kidder , Peabody and Co . He said the merger "" lost a lot of its appeal "" when the U . S . Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation . Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker - Hughes , Pace said "" 30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that ."" "" They ( Hughes ) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit ,"" said James Crandell , analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc . "" Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position , I don ' t know . "" It ' s getting a little confusing ,"" said James Carroll , analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc . He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "" tend to be weak ."" Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22 , the projected merger date . A government decree allowed a longer period of time . Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled . Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale . Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed . But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs . Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed "" the outlook for the industry has improved materially ."" Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting ."

ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial advisor , Smith Barney , Harris Upham And Co Inc , to seek other purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value . ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan , or "" poison pill ,"" during a 120 - intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all - cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers .

Last week , Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs .

ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its commmon , other than by an all cash tender offer for all its shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board . It said the rights expire July three 1987 , or 60 days after they become exercisable if later than that date . It said its board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time prior to their exercise date .

Dome has pledged its 42 . 5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank , estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs , and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt , analysts said . "" The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset ,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named . Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy , but reaffirmed the company ' s 23 . 3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd & lt ; DM > is up for sale "" at the right price ."" Dome , now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6 . 10 billion dlrs in debt , sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell , spokesman David Annesley said . The Encor shares do not pay dividends . A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake . At current market prices , Dome ' s stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs , while its 20 . 9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs . Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer , analysts said . "" Encor ' s stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices ,"" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented . "" The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years ,"" he added . Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7 - 1 / 8 , near its 52 - week high of 7 - 1 / 2 and up from around six dlrs in early February . The company also recently set up its own operating management , which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum , Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented . Dome and Encor "" are actually going to get farther apart . So ( the sale ) does make a lot of sense ,"" Mote said . However , analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome ' s debt to Commerce Bank . "" I think they ' ll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can ,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber . Some of Dome ' s group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale , arguing they have a claim on company assets . "" Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them ,"" said analyst Gobert . Another stumbling block would be Encor ' s 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration . Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum ' s interest in Dome Mines . Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum ' s debt and has a "" right of consent "" to the sale of Dome Petroleum ' s holding . Presumably , a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company ' s debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum , Gobert said . Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares , but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "" are very attractive ."""

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match . Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier & lt ; NOBL ST >, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake , about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option , the statement said . Swedish Match ' s B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday . The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares . The statement said the deal increased Investor ' s stake to 49 . 4 pct of the voting rights and 14 . 8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34 . 1 pct of the voting rights and 14 . 5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match . The Wallenbergs ' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company . The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns , share analysts said , making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far - flung interests from outside predators . The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier , an arms and chemicals group , to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo & lt ; VOLV ST > out of two other key group companies , Atlas Copco & lt ; ASTS ST > and Stora Koppabergs & lt ; SKPS ST >.

Sosnoff , who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values , said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat . "" My advisers felt that , had I given you advance notice , you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration ,"" he said . Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him .

Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler ' s proposed purchase of its much - smaller rival , but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short - term dilution in Chrysler ' s earnings .

790,"AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS American Express Co , rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc , said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon ' s access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition . In a joint statement , American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express ' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters . American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place . Last week , rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm . Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public . There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson , but the plan was considered highly unlikely , analysts said . American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement . The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday , as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5 - 1 / 2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74 . It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees . Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly - owned brokerage , which improved its after - tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year . Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm . Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express ' 1 . 25 billion dlr net in 1986 . American Express ' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring . Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3 . 5 billion dlrs . To some however , the need for added capital is puzzling . ""( American ) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to ,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential - Bache Securities . Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday . Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added , previously vacant , post of president . The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson ' s operating divisions , a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company . Analysts , contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week ' s market speculation . It does confirm , however , that the financial services firm , which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year , is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition . Late last year , Shearson ' s takeover offer to the E . F . Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton , and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage ."

793,"CHRYSLER & lt ; C > DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS Chrysler Corp ' s 1 . 5 billion dlr bid to takeover American Motors Corp & lt ; AMO > should help bolster the small automaker ' s sales , but it leaves the future of its 19 , 000 employees in doubt , industry analysts say . It was "" business as usual "" yesterday at the American Motors headquarters , one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by Chrysler and AMC ' s French parent Renault , according to company spokesman Edd Snyder . But AMC ' s future , to be discussed at a board meeting today , would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state - run French car group as its controlling shareholder . Industry analysts said the future of AMC ' s car assembly plant in Kenosha , Wis ., and its Toledo , Ohio , Jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass . Both plants are far from "" state of the art "" for car manufacturing sites , and AMC has a history of poor labor relations at each . "" Chrysler doesn ' t need that many new plants ,"" said Michael Luckey , automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Brothers . "" They probably will close the Toledo plant and move Jeep production to Canada ."" Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the very least , the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union local representing Jeep workers . "" The UAW won ' t be able to hold them up for ransom as they have AMC because during a down year , Chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production ,"" he said . Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry ' s biggest merger since American Motors was formed in 1954 . AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France for Renault to cut its backing . The company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the earliest . In announcing the takeover agreement , Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca cited AMC ' s Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln dlr assembly plant at Bramalea , Ontario , and its network of 1 , 200 dealers as the major attractions . Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur in the AMC buyout ."

Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid , but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company . Hutton LBO , a wholly owned subsidiary of E . F . Hutton Group Inc , will be majority owner of the company . Hutton said the acquiring company , PC Acquisition Inc , is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator ' s stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday . The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition , containing Purolator ' s U . S . courier operations . If all the shares of Purolator are tendered , shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash , six dlrs in debentures , and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U .

It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs , and previously sold its auto filters business . Purolator retains its Stant division , which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks . A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant . Purolator ' s courier business has been lagging that of its U . S . rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet . E . F . Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction .

Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business , its president Warren Idsal said . "" Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U .

Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold . An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit . The Baker - Hughes merger , which would would create a 1 . 2 billion dlr oilfield services company , almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business . Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger . Hughes ' Kistler , speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes ' shareholders approved the merger , said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business . The previous agreement had proposed a three - month period . Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting , if necessary , an additional three - month extension to complete the sale . He said there were "" several people looking "" at the domestic drilling bit business . The companies , Kistler said , have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore .

Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course . "" We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven ,"" he said .

Leigh - Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors , suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in . "" Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators , for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are , after all , the proprietors of the company ,"" Leigh - Pemberton said .
